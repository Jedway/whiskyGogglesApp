### Demo and Walkthrough
- Watch the demo video of how the app works here:

### Minor quirks and features:
- The live hosted version of the app can be installed as a PWA for a somewhat native feel
- The app is intuitive to use. You can either upload an image or take a picture using your webcam or the rear camera of your mobile device.
- Dark/Light mode toggle to set the mood
- Hamburger menu features an "Analysis History" that lists all the scan results you've gotten for your session 

### Gallery
On mac as a PWA:
